regime_classifier.py  (v3 — July 2026 band/guard patch)
=======================================================

v3 CHANGELOG (vs v2):
  FIX 6  BAND, not sign. Every non-crisis branch was gated on
         `short_real_rate < 0`. On 2026-07-29 the short real policy rate read
         +0.10% (EFFR ~3.58% - CPI 3.50%), which made inflationary_repression,
         hard_repression AND stagflation unreachable simultaneously and dumped
         the classifier into goldilocks -- whose overlay is VGT +4, QQQ +3,
         SMH +2. It instructed ADDING to semis on the fourth consecutive down
         session of a 12% SMH drawdown. |short_real| < 0.25% is now its own
         regime: transition_ambiguous. See regime_bands.py.
  FIX 7  LEADERSHIP GUARD on goldilocks. Positive real rates plus tight credit
         are NECESSARY for goldilocks, not SUFFICIENT. The branch is now
         blocked while the growth complex is >10% below its own 60-day high.
         Fails CLOSED, matching _gold_trend_ok()'s precedent.
  FIX 8  The gold momentum gate now covers EVERY regime that adds GLD.
         v2 gated inflationary_repression (+3) only, leaving hard_repression
         (+4) and stagflation (+4) ungated -- so two of the three regimes that
         buy gold could still buy it into a confirmed downtrend. As of
         2026-07-29 GLD sits ~10% below a FALLING 200d with an active death
         cross, so this is live, not theoretical.
  FIX 9  repression_score() reports top-weight points, the hollow flag, and the
         RAW 2s10s momentum. A 5 built entirely from fiscal/plumbing components
         is not the same state as a 5 that includes the two real-yield gauges,
         and the band label alone hides the difference.
  FIX 10 full_assessment() now FORWARDS fed_bs_expanding and
         deficit_gt_5pct_gdp to repression_score(), and fetch_prices to
         classify_regime(). Previously both flags were silently dropped, so the
         live score was structurally capped at 8/10 and permanently degraded.

v2 CHANGELOG (vs v1):
Shared macro-regime engine for the Repression Dashboard and the All-Weather
Portfolio Dashboard.

Core idea implemented here (per the crux correction):
  There are TWO different "real yields" and they must never be conflated.

    1. SHORT real policy rate  = EFFR (DFF) - trailing CPI YoY   -> repression gauge
    2. LONG  real market yield = DFII10 (10y TIPS yield)         -> duration friend/foe

  The SIGN of (1) and the DIRECTION (momentum) of (2), combined with HY credit
  spreads and the 60-day stock/bond correlation, place us in one of FIVE regime
  quadrants, each of which maps to a target portfolio tilt.

v2 CHANGELOG (vs v1):
  FIX 1  Overlays are now sum-zero by construction (asserted at import).
         v1's inflationary_repression overlay summed to -6, so renormalization
         silently scaled UNTOUCHED sleeves up ~6.4% — VGT rose 20%->21.3% in
         the one regime whose defining signal (rising long real yields)
         compresses growth multiples. Overlays now trim growth explicitly.
  FIX 2  The GLD tilt in inflationary_repression is MOMENTUM-GATED
         (Level-4 entry confirmation). Rising long real yields are gold's
         primary headwind; the regime must not mechanically add to a metal
         in a confirmed downtrend. Gate fails -> the +3 redirects to SGOV.
  FIX 3  New HARD_REPRESSION regime. v1 had no rule for (short real negative,
         long real FALLING, credit tight) — the max-metals, TLT-viable
         quadrant — so it fell through to 'neutral' with no tilts.
  FIX 4  USFR is no longer cut with SGOV. Floaters' coupons RISE with hikes;
         when the front-end risk is a hike (June 2026 SEP: 3.8% end-2026),
         USFR is a beneficiary, not dead cash.
  FIX 5  classify_regime surfaces missing DFII10 momentum instead of silently
         treating None as "not rising". Precedence comments added.
  NEW    repression_score(): the 0-10 stacking score from the written
         framework, now in code. The quadrant says WHAT; the score says HOW
         HARD to tilt.

    # real rates sit.
    #
    # WHY IT HAS TO EXIST: on 2026-08-14 payrolls were -23,000, retail sales
    # had fallen the most in over a year, and consumer sentiment was 51.0 --
    # an unambiguous growth scare that this classifier could not name,
    # because `stagflation` requires a decisively NEGATIVE short real rate
    # and the rate was +0.27%. A framework that cannot label a contracting
    # economy is not a macro framework.
    #
    # OVERLAY REASONING, sleeve by sleeve:
    #   Growth/cyclicals cut (-11): VGT, QQQ, SMH, XLE, PDBC. Earnings
    #       estimates fall in a contraction and high-multiple names de-rate
    #       hardest; energy and broad commodities are demand-sensitive.

    #       demand), SGOV/USFR (paid to wait), KMLM (trend is the one sleeve
    #       agnostic to WHICH way this resolves).
    #   TLT deliberately UNCHANGED at 0. A growth scare argues for duration;
    #       a term-premium/fiscal scare argues violently against it, and the
    #       two look identical at the start. The HY>5% liquidity_crisis
    #       override already re-arms TLT for the genuinely deflationary case,

    # v5: TERM PREMIUM REPRICING -- structurally the INVERSE of financial
    # repression, and the state this framework previously could not name.
    #
    # Repression is: negative front-end real rates, a SUPPRESSED long end,
    # savers quietly liquidated. This is the opposite on every axis: savers
    # PAID a positive real rate at the front end, the long end RISING because
    # buyers demand more compensation, and the currency WEAKENING even as
    # yields climb.
    #
    # That last part is the whole signal. Higher yields normally ATTRACT
    # foreign capital and support the currency. When yields rise and the
    # dollar falls simultaneously, the higher yield is not pricing better
    # growth or higher expected inflation -- it is pricing the RISK of
    # holding the paper at all: fiscal sustainability, supply, credibility.
    # indicators.score_dollar_divergence() has detected exactly this pattern
    # for some time, but it fed only the Repression Watch scorecard and never
    # reached this classifier -- the signal existed and the regime engine
    # could not hear it.
    #
    # OVERLAY REASONING:
    #   TLT -6   Long duration is the DIRECT loser. Term premium expansion is
    #            precisely a repricing of long-dated paper downward. This is
    #            the largest single tilt in the overlay for that reason.
    #   VGT -4, QQQ -2, SMH -1  Long-duration EQUITY. Rising discount rates
    #            hit the assets whose value sits furthest in the future,
    #            which is exactly high-multiple growth.
    #   GLD +4, SLV +2  The classic debasement hedge. Gold's whole case is a
    #            currency losing credibility while real assets hold it.
    #   PDBC +2, XLE +1  Commodities are priced in dollars; a weakening
    #            dollar is a mechanical tailwind.
    #   KMLM +2  Trend is agnostic to WHICH way this resolves, and this is
    #            precisely the kind of persistent directional move it
    #            captures.
    #   USFR +2  Floating rate. The front end pays a positive REAL rate here
    #            (unlike repression, where it does not) and the coupon RISES
    #            if the Fed responds to currency weakness by tightening.

# actively WRONG when the guard routed here: on 2026-08-13 the short real
# rate was a decisively positive +0.27%, not "at zero" -- the valuation
# guard (CAPE 42, concentration 50.8%) is what redirected here, and the
# banner told a different story than the "Why" line right below it.

# Fix keeps the single "transition_ambiguous" KEY -- and therefore every
# downstream consumer (target_weights, the quadrant table, the repression
# score, checklist_tab) is untouched -- and only makes the DISPLAYED
# label/blurb depend on WHY this call landed here. band_ambiguous keeps the
