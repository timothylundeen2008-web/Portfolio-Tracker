=================================
The short-real-rate BAND and the equity-leadership GUARD.

WHY THIS MODULE EXISTS
----------------------
Every non-crisis branch in classify_regime() was gated on the same bare
inequality:

    short_real_rate < 0

On 2026-07-29 the short real policy rate read approximately +0.10%
(EFFR ~3.58% - CPI YoY 3.50%). That single sign flip made THREE regimes
unreachable simultaneously — inflationary_repression, hard_repression, and
stagflation — and the classifier fell through to `goldilocks`, whose overlay
is:

    VGT +4, QQQ +3, SMH +2, GLD -3, SLV -2, TLT -4, KMLM -2, SGOV +2

i.e. it instructed ADDING to semiconductors and growth tech on a day the
Nasdaq 100 was in a technical correction 11% off its June high, the fourth
consecutive down session for SMH, and the Dow's worst decline since April
2025. That is not a mislabel. That is actively harmful sizing advice
produced by a 10-basis-point move in a number derived from a CPI print that
was distorted -0.4% m/m by a one-month energy collapse.

TWO FIXES, BOTH DEFENSIVE
-------------------------
1. BAND, not sign. |short_real| < TRANSITION_BAND is its own state. A gauge
   sitting inside its own measurement noise should say "I don't know", not
   pick a side. Band default 0.25% ~= one month of CPI noise.

2. LEADERSHIP GUARD. `goldilocks` cannot be confirmed while the growth
   complex is in a >10% drawdown from its own 60-day high. Positive real
   rates plus tight credit are necessary for goldilocks; they are not
   sufficient, and equity internals are the missing third leg.

FAIL DIRECTION
--------------
Both fail CLOSED, following the precedent already set by _gold_trend_ok()
in regime_classifier.py ("Fail SAFE: any data problem returns False — no
momentum data -> no add"). Missing price data cannot confirm goldilocks, so
it returns the conservative transition state with an explicit degraded
driver. Failing OPEN here would mean a data outage silently re-enables the
most aggressive overlay in the book.

INTEGRATION
-----------
See PATCHES.md. Three call sites in regime_classifier.classify_regime()
plus one new entry in the REGIMES dict.

#
#   Growth trimmed  (-5)  Adding growth requires a CONFIRMED positive real
#                         rate; an unconfirmed one is not a reason to buy
#                         multiple expansion.
#   Metals trimmed  (-4)  Adding metals requires a CONFIRMED negative real
#                         rate; symmetric logic, opposite side.
#   TLT trimmed     (-3)  Long duration stays hostage to term premium
#                         regardless of where the FRONT end resolves. This is
#                         the one sleeve the ambiguity does not rescue.
#   Floaters  +4 / Bills +3  Carry with no duration risk. Paid to wait, and
#                         floaters specifically benefit if the ambiguity
#                         resolves toward hikes.
#   Trend     +3          Trend is regime-agnostic — it profits from whichever
#                         way the long end resolves, which is exactly the
#                         exposure you want when you cannot call the direction.
#   Defensives +2         Small tilt to cash-flow and healthcare; pricing
#                         power is robust to both resolutions.
